The query I code I used to fetch the data source from BigQuery for the dashboard:

1. NYCITYBIKE_by.date
SELECT
  CAST(starttime AS date) AS date,
  COUNT(*) AS num_trips,
  ROUND(SUM(tripduration/60),2) AS total_duration_minutes,
  COUNT(DISTINCT bikeid) AS num_bikes
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  starttime IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  date
ORDER BY
  date
  
  2. ny_city_bike_by.bikeid
  SELECT
  bikeid,
  CAST(starttime AS date) AS date,
  COUNT(*) AS num_trips,
  ROUND(SUM(tripduration/60),2) AS total_trip_duration_minutes
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  starttime IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  date,
  bikeid

3. ny_city_bike_by.gender 
SELECT
  CAST(starttime AS date) AS date,
  usertype,
  gender,
  COUNT(*) AS num_trips,
  ROUND(SUM(tripduration/60),2) AS total_trip_duration_minutes
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  starttime IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  date,
  usertype,
  gender
ORDER BY
  date,
  usertype,
  gender
  
  4. ny_city_bike_by.station
  SELECT
  CAST(starttime AS date) AS date,
  start_station_name,
  COUNT(*) AS num_trips,
  COUNT(DISTINCT bikeid) AS num_bikes,
  ROUND(SUM(tripduration/60),2) AS total_trip_duration_minutes
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  starttime IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  date,
  start_station_name
ORDER BY
  date
